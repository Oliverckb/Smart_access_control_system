# Smart Access Control System

## Motivation

When the base station needs equipment installation, daily inspection work and design survey, the personnel who intend to enter the base station must go to the key management unit to borrow the key of the base station, and return the key after the operation is completed. Especially in some base stations in remote mountainous areas, it takes a lot of time to pick up and send keys, and even wrong keys have occurred, seriously affecting work efficiency.

## Introduction
The access control system unlock the door based on 2FSK modulation signal.
